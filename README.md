# Debugging Challenges

In each of the folders of this repository you will find small Python programmes!

- Each of the programs will have between 1-7 bugs of various types
- Some challenges will have tests, others will have sample output, others will have neither
  - If this is the case then it's up to you to assume or work out when working output is
